âœ¨ Features
This application comes packed with a variety of features to make managing your class schedule simple and efficient:
Dynamic Timetable Display: The app intelligently shows you the very next class you have, whether it's later today or on a future day.
Weekend Mode: On Saturdays and Sundays, the app displays a motivational quote to help you relax and recharge for the week ahead.

Multiple Viewing Options:
View by Day: Browse the full schedule for any day of the week.
View by Subject: Select a specific subject to see all its scheduled classes throughout the week.

User Authentication: Utilizes Firebase's anonymous authentication to provide a personalized experience without requiring users to create an account with a password.

Visitor Logging & Analytics:
Securely logs every user's first visit.
Tracks the total number of logins and the timestamp of the last visit for every user, providing valuable analytics.

Permanent Dark Mode: The UI is locked in a developer-friendly dark theme. A theme-toggle button is included, 
which humorously informs the user that light mode is "forbidden" for CSE students.
Logout Functionality: A simple and clear logout button allows users to end their session and return to the welcome screen.
Fully Responsive: The layout is designed to work beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
